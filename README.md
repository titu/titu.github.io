# Project Details

<!--[![titu.github.io](/assets/screenshot.gif)](https://titu.github.io)-->
I was looking into creating a portfolio app which can be easily configured just only providing the data. I ended up creating this application which needs zero configuration and data in JSON format. That is really user friendly as no need to worry about the UI, style or anything. User can place his/her data as text and their images/screenshots for portfolio in proper directory and the app is ready!

I will continuously furnish this application by adding new features and fixing issues. It would be highly appreciated if you fork this repo, report an issue if found, suggesting new features or send a pull request.

I've deployed this portfolio app to Github Page. GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations.

- React
- Tailwind CSS
